Directories used to store clean speech and noise for validation and training,
as well as noisy speech for testing.

For the validation set only:

Identical filenames for the clean speech and noise must be placed in
'val_clean_speech' and 'val_noise', with the SNR at the end of the filename. As
an example:

'./val_clean_speech/ANY_NAME_15dB.wav'

contains the clean speech, and

'./val_noise/ANY_NAME_15dB.wav' 

contains the noise at the same length. They will be mixed together at the SNR
level specified in the filename.

Another example:

'./val_clean_speech/198_19-198-0003_Machinery17_15dB.wav'

and

'./val_noise/198_19-198-0003_Machinery17_15dB.wav'
